# Img-Denoising_Autoencoders
Image Denoising using autoencoders in keras and python
Dataset Used -- MNIST handwritten digit dataset containing 60,000 training and 10,000 testing 28*28 images.
AIM of Project -- To remove noise from images in the dataset and give a clear image so that further operations can be done on the dataset effectively.

<li>Autoencoders are a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that are used to perform task of data encoding(representation learning).
<li>Noisy image is fed from MNIST dataset as input.
<li>The output is clean/denoised image.
